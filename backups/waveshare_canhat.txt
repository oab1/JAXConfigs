I figured out what’s wrong with it.
In waveshare’s docs 1 there’s a line of config:

dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=8000000,interrupt=25,spimaxfrequency=1000000

spimaxfrequency needs to be taken out.

Figured this out. The updated Klipper instructions are missing this line which needs to be added to /boot/config.txt:

dtoverlay=spi1-1cs
